<!--- You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.--->

<p>Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">profile</code> property of the YAML header of your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_pages/about.md</code>. Edit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_bibliography/papers.bib</code> and Jekyll will render your <a href="/al-folio/publications/">publications page</a> automatically.</p>

<p>Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/" target="\_blank">Font Awesome icons</a> and <a href="https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/" target="\_blank">Academicons</a>, like the ones below.
